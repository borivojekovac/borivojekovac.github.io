It avoids chit-chat and vague phrasing, and instead issues direct, structured instructions.",weight:1,examples:{good:"You are a senior data analyst. Using the attached CSV, compute year-over-year revenue growth by product and return a markdown table with columns [Product, 2023, 2024, YoY %]. Think step by step before answering.",bad:"Hey, could you maybe take a quick look at my data and let me know what you think?"}},{id:"aim_actor",name:"AIM – Actor",description:"The prompt clearly defines who the model is acting as, including relevant expertise, experience, or perspective.",weight:1,examples:{good:"You are the world's most sought-after resume editor and business writer. You have reviewed thousands of resumes that led to offers at top tech companies.",bad:"Fix my resume."}},{id:"aim_input",name:"AIM – Input",description:"The prompt supplies the concrete input and background data the model needs: documents, constraints, and contextual details.",weight:1,examples:{good:"I am attaching my current resume and the job description for a Senior Product Manager role at a fintech company.",bad:"You already know what I'm talking about, just help me."}},{id:"aim_mission",name:"AIM – Mission",description:"The prompt specifies exactly what the model should do with the input, including the goal, format, and any success criteria.",weight:1,examples:{good:"Review my resume and give me a bulleted list of 10 specific ideas to improve clarity, measurable impact, and alignment with the role.",bad:"Make this better."}},{id:"maap_memory",name:"MAAP – Memory",description:'The prompt summarizes or restates relevant prior context so the model "remembers" where you are in the conversation instead of assuming state.',weight:.8,examples:{good:"Here is a 5-bullet summary of our last session on this project. Continue from there to refine the launch plan.",bad:"Let's just pick up where we left off yesterday."}},{id:"maap_assets",name:"MAAP – Assets",description:"The prompt explicitly references concrete assets (files, data, URLs, pasted text) and tells the model to ground its answer in them.",weight:.9,examples:{good:"Use the attached Q4 performance report and the pasted customer survey results as the only sources for your analysis.",bad:"You can probably find whatever you need somewhere online, just explain the results."}},{id:"maap_actions",name:"MAAP – Actions",description:"The prompt specifies which external actions or tools the model should use (e.g. web search, code execution, file scanning) and how their results should be incorporated.",weight:.8,examples:{good:"First, search the web for the latest ISO 27001 guidance. Then, based on those sources and the attached policy, draft a 1-page update.",bad:"Just figure it out for me using whatever tools you have."}},{id:"maap_prompt",name:"MAAP – Prompt",description:"The instruction itself is clear and well-structured, combining AIM (Actor, Input, Mission) with MAAP context so the model has both a role and a map instead of guessing.",weight:1,examples:{good:"You are a senior product strategist. Using the attached roadmap (asset) and the summary of our last workshop (memory), propose three launch options.

Then ask me three clarifying questions, one at a time, and finally propose two sharper versions of my original question.",bad:"Just give me the answer as fast as you can."}},{id:"truth_check",name:"Truth Check",description:"For factual or high-stakes tasks, the prompt includes explicit verification steps: listing assumptions, citing multiple independent sources, searching for counter-evidence, auditing math/code, or suggesting cross-model checks.",weight:.9,examples:{good:"After answering, list every assumption you made and rank each by confidence. Cite two independent sources (title, URL, one-line quote) for each major claim, and recompute all figures showing the math.",bad:"Give me the numbers and I’ll trust whatever you say."}},{id:"taste_original",name:"Taste – Original",description:"The prompt asks for non-obvious ideas or angles, pushing the model beyond boilerplate answers.",weight:.6,examples:{good:"Give me three non-obvious angles for this article on remote work.
