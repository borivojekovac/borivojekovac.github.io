OCEAN merged into taste_quality, Memory+Assets merged into maap_context.",o=[{id:"machine_english",name:"Machine English",description:"The prompt uses sharp, targeted 'machine English': it talks to the model like a probabilistic token predictor, not like a person. It avoids chit-chat and vague phrasing, and instead issues direct, structured instructions.",weight:1,examples:{good:"You are a senior data analyst. Using the attached CSV, compute year-over-year revenue growth by product and return a markdown table with columns [Product, 2023, 2024, YoY %]. Think step by step before answering.",bad:"Hey, could you maybe take a quick look at my data and let me know what you think?"}},{id:"aim_actor",name:"AIM – Actor",description:"The prompt clearly defines who the model is acting as, including relevant expertise, experience, or perspective.",weight:1,examples:{good:"You are the world's most sought-after resume editor and business writer. You have reviewed thousands of resumes that led to offers at top tech companies.",bad:"Fix my resume."}},{id:"aim_input",name:"AIM – Input",description:"The prompt supplies the concrete input and background data the model needs: documents, constraints, and contextual details.",weight:1,examples:{good:"I am attaching my current resume and the job description for a Senior Product Manager role at a fintech company.",bad:"You already know what I'm talking about, just help me."}},{id:"aim_mission",name:"AIM – Mission",description:"The prompt specifies exactly what the model should do with the input, including the goal, format, and any success criteria.",weight:1,examples:{good:"Review my resume and give me a bulleted list of 10 specific ideas to improve clarity, measurable impact, and alignment with the role.",bad:"Make this better."}},{id:"maap_context",name:"MAAP – Context",description:"The prompt provides grounding context: prior conversation summary (memory) and/or concrete assets (files, data, URLs) that the model should use as its source of truth.",weight:.85,examples:{good:"Here is a summary of our last session and the attached Q4 report. Use only these sources for your analysis.",bad:"You can probably find whatever you need somewhere online."}},{id:"maap_actions",name:"MAAP – Actions",description:"The prompt specifies which external actions or tools the model should use (e.g. web search, code execution, file scanning) and how their results should be incorporated.",weight:.8,examples:{good:"First, search the web for the latest ISO 27001 guidance. Then, based on those sources and the attached policy, draft a 1-page update.",bad:"Just figure it out for me using whatever tools you have."}},{id:"maap_prompt",name:"MAAP – Prompt",description:"The instruction itself is clear and well-structured, combining AIM (Actor, Input, Mission) with MAAP context so the model has both a role and a map instead of guessing.",weight:1,examples:{good:"You are a senior product strategist. Using the attached roadmap (asset) and the summary of our last workshop (memory), propose three launch options. Think step by step and then recommend one option with clear trade-offs.",bad:"What should we do about our product launch?"}},{id:"expert_steering",name:"Expert Steering",description:"The prompt avoids vague, generic requests and steers the model toward specific experts, frameworks, or research to escape 'average' answers.",weight:.9,examples:{good:"Explain how to make a product team more innovative using Pixar's Braintrust model, Satya Nadella's strategy principles, and recent Harvard research.",bad:"How do I make my team more innovative?"}},{id:"reasoning_patterns",name:"Reasoning Patterns",description:"The prompt builds in iterative debugging patterns such as chain-of-thought reasoning, clarifying questions, or asking the model to propose sharper versions of the prompt.",weight:.7,examples:{good:"Think step by step and show your reasoning before the final answer. Then ask me three clarifying questions, one at a time, and finally propose two sharper versions of my original question.",bad:"Just give me the answer as fast as you can."}},{id:"truth_check",name:"Truth Check",description:"For factual or high-stakes tasks, the prompt includes explicit verification steps: listing assumptions, citing multiple independent sources, searching for counter-evidence, auditing math/code, or suggesting cross-model checks.",weight:.9,examples:{good:"After answering, list every assumption you made and rank each by confidence. Cite two independent sources (title, URL, one-line quote) for each major claim, and recompute all figures showing the math.",bad:"Give me the numbers and I'll trust whatever you say."}},{id:"taste_quality",name:"Taste & Quality",description:"The prompt pushes for high-quality output: original ideas (not boilerplate), concrete examples, visible reasoning, assertive stance, and narrative flow rather than disconnected bullet points.",weight:.6,examples:{good:"Give me three non-obvious angles backed by real examples.
