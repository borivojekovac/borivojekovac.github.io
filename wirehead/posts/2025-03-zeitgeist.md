# Zeitgeist: The Factory Floor

## Forty billion dollars flows into OpenAI, reasoning models learn to show their work, and autonomous agents start booking flights without asking. March 2025 is when intelligence manufacturing goes industrial.

Jensen Huang takes the stage at GTC in San Jose, 25,000 bodies in seats and 300,000 watching remotely, and delivers the sermon: [Blackwell Ultra](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-ultra "Nvidia Blackwell Ultra announcement"), built for reasoning, 1.5x more compute than its predecessor, the silicon that makes chain-of-thought economically viable. But the real message is architectural. Huang keeps saying "AI factory" - data centers that don't store information but [manufacture intelligence](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3952847/nvidia-gtc-2025-ai-factories-are-the-blueprint-for-modern-enterprise-architecture.html "Network World on AI factories as enterprise blueprint"). Purpose-built facilities drinking 1,400 watts per chip, the thermal wall forcing a [mandatory shift to liquid cooling](https://www.financialcontent.com/article/2025/03/18/thermal-wall-forces-industry-shift-to-liquid-cooling "Financial Content on thermal wall and liquid cooling"). The infrastructure layer hardens into something that resembles petrochemical plants more than server farms.

The capital follows the concrete. On the month's final day, [SoftBank commits $40 billion to OpenAI](https://www.reuters.com/technology/softbank-invest-up-40-billion-openai-wsj-reports-2025-03-31/ "Reuters on SoftBank's $40 billion OpenAI investment") - one of the largest private funding rounds in history, valuing the company at $260 billion. [xAI raises $20 billion](https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-xai-20-billion-funding-round "Mashable on xAI's $20 billion raise") despite Grok's controversies. [AI companies are on track for record funding](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/2025-funding-record-openai-anthropic-xai/ "Crunchbase on record AI funding"), the [LA Times warns of bubble territory](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-03-15/ai-companies-raised-record-150-billion-fears-of-bubble "LA Times on AI bubble fears"). The bet is explicit: intelligence as infrastructure requires infrastructure-scale investment.

The reasoning race accelerates on three continents. [OpenAI ships GPT-4.5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/ "OpenAI GPT-4.5 announcement") on March 1st, their largest chat model yet. Three weeks later, [DeepSeek drops V3-0324](https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseek-releases-v3-0324-intensifying-rivalry-openai-2025-03-24/ "Reuters on DeepSeek V3-0324 release") under MIT license, lessons from R1 folded into enhanced reasoning. Google caps the month with [Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-2-5-pro-experimental/ "Google Gemini 2.5 Pro announcement"), a "thinking model" that reasons through steps before responding. The pattern locks in: not bigger models, but models that [take time to think](https://arcprize.org/blog/chain-of-thought-reasoning "ARC Prize on chain-of-thought methods"). Test-time compute becomes the new scaling law.

Then Hangzhou delivers another jolt. A startup called Monica launches [Manus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/03/06/manus-ai-agent-changes-everything/ "Forbes on Manus AI agent"), billed as the first general AI agent - a system that books flights, debugs applications, writes reports without waiting for prompts at each step. [MIT Technology Review tests it](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/manus-ai-agent-hands-on-review/ "MIT Technology Review Manus hands-on"), finding crashes and server overloads but also "real promise." The distinction sharpens: ChatGPT augments, Claude automates, Manus acts. [Bolt.new hits $40 million ARR](https://sacra.com/research/bolt-new-ai-development-platform/ "Sacra on Bolt.new growth") in months, proof that developers will pay for AI that builds rather than suggests.

The legal machinery grinds into motion. [State legislatures introduce hundreds of AI bills](https://www.techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/us-states-introduce-hundreds-of-ai-bills/ "TechCrunch on state AI legislation") - Maryland regulating high-risk decisions, Texas drafting a comprehensive governance act, Massachusetts demanding insurers disclose algorithmic coverage denials. The patchwork thickens in the absence of federal action. [Over 50 active lawsuits](https://www.debevoise.com/insights/publications/2025/03/ai-copyright-litigation-tracker "Debevoise AI copyright litigation tracker") pit rights holders against AI companies, the music industry particularly aggressive. The era of training on whatever could be scraped ends; licensing and provenance become legal necessities.

The factory floor is operational now. Forty billion here, twenty billion there, liquid cooling and five-gigawatt substations - the physical plant for manufacturing intelligence at industrial scale. What runs on it thinks before it answers, acts before it's asked. The question is no longer whether AI can reason or take initiative. The question is who owns the output, and what happens when the machines start making decisions faster than the lawyers can write rules.
