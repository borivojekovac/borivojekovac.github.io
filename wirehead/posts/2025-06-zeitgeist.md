# Zeitgeist: Renting the Future

## Apple outsources its brain to OpenAI, Meta spends $15 billion on a single hire, robots learn physics, and courts finally rule on training data. June 2025 is the month everyone admits they can't do it alone.

The summer heat arrives with a strange inversion. At WWDC, Apple unveils [Liquid Glass](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/wwdc-2025-announcements/ "Apple WWDC 2025 announcements") - the biggest visual redesign in a decade - but the real story is what's running underneath. [Live Translation](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/apple-wwdc-2025-ai-features/ "TechCrunch on Apple's AI features") flows through Messages and FaceTime, [Visual Intelligence](https://www.theverge.com/2025/6/9/apple-intelligence-visual-screen-analysis "The Verge on Visual Intelligence") reads your screen, and somewhere in the fine print, [ChatGPT powers Image Playground](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/09/apple-chatgpt-image-playground-integration/ "TechCrunch on ChatGPT integration"). Cupertino's message is clear: if you can't build the brain, rent one. Siri sits conspicuously absent from the keynote, a ghost in the machine waiting for someone else's intelligence to animate it.

The agentic tools that debuted in May now scale. [GitHub opens Copilot's coding agent to Business subscribers](https://github.blog/2025-06-24-copilot-coding-agent-business/ "GitHub Blog on Copilot agent expansion"), extending autonomous coding to twenty million developers across 77,000 enterprises. [Claude Opus 4 joins the roster](https://github.blog/2025-06-25-claude-models-github-copilot/ "GitHub Blog on Claude availability"), giving teams a choice of backends - OpenAI for some tasks, Anthropic for others. The multi-model IDE arrives. Gartner names GitHub a Leader in AI Code Assistants for the second consecutive year; the category itself barely existed three years ago.

The reasoning wars heat up. [OpenAI ships o3-pro](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/10/openai-o3-pro-reasoning-model/ "TechCrunch on o3-pro") on June 10th, outpacing Gemini 2.5 Pro on math benchmarks. Hours later, [Mistral drops Magistral](https://mistral.ai/news/magistral-reasoning-models/ "Mistral AI Magistral announcement") - its first reasoning family, the smaller variant open-sourced under Apache 2.0. Europe's answer to Silicon Valley now has a thinking model of its own.

Mark Zuckerberg, apparently dissatisfied with Llama 4's April debut, announces [Meta Superintelligence Labs](https://www.theverge.com/2025/6/meta-superintelligence-labs-announcement "The Verge on Meta Superintelligence Labs") - a new division aimed at something beyond current capabilities. To lead it, he writes a check that rewrites the talent market: [Alexandr Wang, Scale AI's founder, becomes Meta's first Chief AI Officer](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/alexandr-wang-meta-chief-ai-officer/ "TechCrunch on Wang hire") in a deal worth nearly $15 billion. The number hangs in the air like a weather system. When a single hire costs more than most companies' entire AI budgets, the game has changed.

The physical layer stirs. [Google DeepMind releases Gemini Robotics On-Device](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-on-device/ "Google DeepMind on Gemini Robotics") - a vision-language-action model that runs locally, learns new tasks from fifty demonstrations, and operates without network dependency. [Meta's V-JEPA 2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-2-world-model/ "Meta AI on V-JEPA 2") teaches machines to predict what happens next in the physical world, enabling zero-shot robot control. The models are learning to think before they move. The warehouse, the factory floor, the hospital corridor - all becoming addressable.

The courts, finally, start rendering verdicts. A federal judge rules that [AI training on books could constitute transformative fair use](https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-training-fair-use-ruling-bartz-anthropic/ "Reuters on fair use ruling") - a lifeline for the industry, though the case settles before appeal. [Meta wins against authors](https://www.theverge.com/2025/6/25/meta-authors-lawsuit-victory "The Verge on Meta lawsuit victory") claiming unauthorized training. But [Disney and Universal sue Midjourney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-universal-midjourney-lawsuit/ "Hollywood Reporter on Disney lawsuit"), and [independent artists file against Suno](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/suno-class-action-lawsuit/ "Music Business Worldwide on Suno lawsuit"). The legal terrain bifurcates: some training is fair use, some isn't, and the difference may come down to whose lawyers bill more hours.

[ChatGPT crosses $10 billion in annual recurring revenue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/chatgpt-10-billion-arr/ "Bloomberg on ChatGPT revenue"). [Meta spends $17 billion on infrastructure in a single quarter](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/meta-ai-infrastructure-spending "CNN on Meta spending"). [New York passes the RAISE Act](https://www.morrisonfoerster.com/insights/new-york-raise-act/ "Morrison Foerster on RAISE Act"), joining California in regulating frontier models, while [European founders beg Brussels to pause the AI Act](https://sifted.eu/articles/eu-ai-act-pause-letter/ "Sifted on AI Act pause letter") before it strangles innovation. The concrete keeps getting poured. The lawyers keep billing. And somewhere between Apple's rented intelligence and Meta's $15 billion handshake, the industry crosses a threshold: AI is no longer something you download. It's something with a physical address, a power bill, and a legal department.
