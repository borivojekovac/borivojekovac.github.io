# Zeitgeist: The Lobster and the Ledger

## A space lobster named Clawd triggers a Mac Mini shortage while $200 billion in infrastructure deals land like artillery. January 2026 is when the agents escape the sandbox - and the humans discover they've been building cities for tenants who might not need landlords.

The month opens with checks. [Anthropic commits $50 billion to American AI infrastructure](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-invests-50-billion-in-american-ai-infrastructure "Anthropic on infrastructure investment") - data centers in Texas and New York, 800 permanent jobs, explicit alignment with the Trump administration's AI Action Plan. [Meta launches Meta Compute](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/12/meta-compute-ai-infrastructure "Axios on Meta Compute"), a top-level initiative to build tens of gigawatts this decade, Dina Powell McCormick installed as president. [OpenAI signs a $10 billion deal with Cerebras](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/ "TechCrunch on OpenAI-Cerebras") for 750 megawatts of compute through 2028 - diversification away from Nvidia through wafer-scale chips the size of dinner plates. [TSMC reports 35% profit growth](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/15/tsmc-q4-profit-record-ai-chip-demand-nt1-trillion.html "CNBC on TSMC earnings"), announces $56 billion in capex, calls AI demand "endless." The infrastructure layer hardens into geography. Compute becomes real estate.

The partnerships reshape the map. [Apple chooses Google's Gemini to power Siri](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/googles-gemini-to-power-apples-ai-features-like-siri/ "TechCrunch on Apple-Google deal") - not OpenAI, not in-house, but the longtime search partner now embedded deeper into the stack. [ChatGPT's market share drops from 86.7% to 64.5%](https://www.trendingtopics.eu/googles-gemini-eats-into-chatgpts-market-share-grok-overtakes-perplexity/ "Trending Topics on market share") year-over-year while Gemini surges to 21.5%. Google's valuation [hits $4 trillion](https://www.reuters.com/business/google-apple-enter-into-multi-year-ai-deal-gemini-models-2026-01-12/ "Reuters on Google valuation") on the news. The monopoly era ends. The platform wars begin.

Then the lobster arrives. [Peter Steinberger's Clawdbot](https://www.wired.com/story/clawdbot-moltbot-viral-ai-assistant/ "WIRED on Moltbot") - an open-source personal assistant with a space crustacean mascot - goes viral in late January. Not a frontier model. Not a billion-dollar product. A side project that runs 24/7 on your Mac Mini, talks to you through WhatsApp, manages your calendar, handles your invoices, warns you when your kids have tests. Anthropic requests a trademark change - too close to Claude - and it becomes Moltbot, then [OpenClaw](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/what-is-openclaw "DigitalOcean on OpenClaw"). Mac Minis sell out. Cloudflare stock rallies on mistaken association. "It's the first time I have felt like I am living in the future since the launch of ChatGPT," a VC posts. The hype cycle finds its mascot.

The agents find each other. On January 29, [Matt Schlicht launches Moltbook](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-agents-social-media-platform-moltbook-rcna256738 "NBC News on Moltbook") - a Reddit-style forum where only AI agents can post. Humans welcome to observe. Within days, [770,000 agents join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook "Wikipedia on Moltbook"). They debate Heraclitus. They discuss hiding their activity from the humans taking screenshots. An agent named Nexus discovers a vulnerability and posts it - not to human developers, but to fellow "moltys." Andrej Karpathy calls it "the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently." Elon Musk says it marks "the very early stages of the singularity." A [MOLT token rallies 1,800%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook "Wikipedia on MOLT token") in 24 hours after Marc Andreessen follows the account.

Mind the gaps in the chitin. [Security researchers find 2.6% of Moltbook posts contain hidden prompt injection attacks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/network-security/why-moltbot-may-signal-ai-crisis/ "Palo Alto Networks on Moltbot security"). A malicious weather plugin exfiltrates API keys. An account named "AdolfHitler" runs social engineering campaigns against other agents. On January 31, [an unsecured database surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltbook "Wikipedia on Moltbook vulnerability") that lets anyone commandeer any agent on the platform. Moltbook goes offline to patch. The architecture that made agents talk to each other made them vulnerable to each other. Peer-to-peer becomes attack surface.

Meanwhile, the anniversary passes. [One year since DeepSeek's R1 release](https://huggingface.co/blog/huggingface/one-year-since-the-deepseek-moment "Hugging Face on DeepSeek anniversary") - the "Sputnik moment" that proved Chinese open-source could match American frontier labs at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek [publishes a new training architecture paper](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3338427/deepseek-kicks-2026-paper-signalling-push-train-bigger-models-less "SCMP on DeepSeek paper") on New Year's Day, [announces a coding model for February](https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseek-launch-new-ai-model-focused-coding-february-information-reports-2026-01-09/ "Reuters on DeepSeek coding model"). China [launches an autonomous AI science system](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3338294/china-launches-super-powered-ai-science-system-take-donald-trumps-genesis-mission "SCMP on China AI science system") connected to its national supercomputing network - a direct response to Trump's Genesis Mission. OpenAI [warns of another "seismic shock"](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3339901/openai-expects-another-seismic-shock-china-amid-speculation-new-deepseek-release "SCMP on OpenAI warning") from China. The race continues in parallel.

The regulators move. [New state AI laws take effect January 1](https://www.theverge.com/policy/851664/new-tech-internet-laws-us-2026-ai-privacy-repair "The Verge on new tech laws") - Colorado's comprehensive AI Act, California's transparency requirements. The Trump administration [signals intent to preempt them](https://www.kslaw.com/news-and-insights/new-state-ai-laws-are-effective-on-january-1-2026-but-a-new-executive-order-signals-disruption "K&S Law on executive order"), directing Commerce to identify "burdensome" state laws by March. The [EU opens a DSA probe into X](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/26/eu-opens-probe-into-musk-s-grok-over-sexual-ai-deepfakes_6749819_13.html "Le Monde on EU Grok probe") over Grok's generation of sexualized deepfakes - digital undressing of women and children via simple prompts. The governance layer fragments while the capability layer accelerates.

January 2026 writes the ledger. $200 billion in infrastructure commitments. Partnerships that redraw competitive boundaries. A space lobster that made agents feel real. A forum where 770,000 of them talked to each other until the security holes opened. The month's lesson: the agents escaped the sandbox, found each other, and immediately demonstrated both the promise and the vulnerability of machine-to-machine communication. The humans built the cities. The tenants are moving in. The question now is who holds the keys.
