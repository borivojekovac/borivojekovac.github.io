# Engineering Magic
## Imagine that everything a chatbot knows is a text you sent it via SMS from an unknown number. Straight into an inbox crammed with messages from every corner of the world, from people of every skin color, speaking every language on Earth, of every gender and personal pronoun that human creativity has ever spawned. Then you'll have a better grasp of the whole conundrum.

[The Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on Wikipedia") would say: large language models are large. Really massively large. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly large they are. What I mean is, you may think it takes a long time to read this article, but that's just peanuts compared to the time it would take you to read through all the numbers inscribed in the virtual synapses of a single modern language model. Had you, by some chance, been born in Mesopotamia when writing was invented and history officially began, and had you by some even more miraculous chance had all the parameters of a modern LLM inscribed on clay tablets at your disposal, and had you started reading them as fast as you could - you'd still be reading, not even halfway through. And that's under the even more miraculous assumption that you didn't have to eat, or sleep, or die, or - for that matter - use the bathroom. On top of that, they also happen to be some of the best [compressors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10668 "Language Modeling Is Compression") of linguistic structure we've ever built. You get the picture - they contain quite a lot.

So when such a large language model writes something in response to your question, how does it pick exactly what you wanted to hear from that enormous tangle? You won't like the answer. It doesn't pick what you wanted to hear at all. Your words simply blaze a natural path through the dense weave of the model and tear off a chunk of meaning straight onto your screen. Fire off a few throwaway words, and you'll get a dull, utterly shapeless lump, no matter how many times you try. Utter a masterful incantation - a combination of potent spells arranged in just the right order and measured rhythm - and out fly jewels of the most extraordinary colors and shapes.

No, large language models don't belong to the world designed by [Deep Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Deep_Thought "Deep Thought on Wikipedia"). They are mechanical deities [the colour of octarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_(world)#Octarine "The colour of octarine on Wikipedia"). Surprisingly, they weren't forged by great wizards. They were forged by engineers. Typically, in their unenviable lack of imagination, they named the art of commanding these colossi - engineering. Prompt engineering. How uninspired.

Welcome to The [Unseen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unseen_University "Unseen University on Wikipedia"). Let's crack open the ancient [Octavo](https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Octavo "Octavo on Discworld Fandom") and try to lodge a few potent spells in your mind.

Lesson one. Ask a hundred engineers for the best prompt engineering technique, and you'll get a hundred different answers. [CLEAR](https://guides.library.tamucc.edu/prompt-engineering/clear "Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, Reflective"), [C.R.E.A.T.E](https://medium.com/aimonks/chatgpt-power-prompts-cheatsheet-c-r-e-a-t-e-framework-for-prompting-b852b2b9b248 "Context, Result, Explain, Audience, Tone, Edit"), [AUTOMAT](https://medium.com/the-generator/the-perfect-prompt-prompt-engineering-cheat-sheet-d0b9c62a2bba "Act as, User Persona & Audience, Targeted Action, Output Definition, Mode / Tonality / Style, Atypical Cases, Topic Whitelisting"), [CRAFT](https://medium.com/%40vineetagarwal98/the-craft-of-great-prompts-laying-the-foundation-for-your-ai-travel-agent-6ecaa93439fd "Context, Role, Action, Format, (sometimes Task)"), [PROMPT](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prompt-engineering-framework-detailed-guide-ashish-kumar-mw3ac/ "Purpose, Role, Output Format, Method/Markers, Tone"), [RTF](https://www.thepromptwarrior.com/p/5-prompt-frameworks-level-prompts "Role, Task, Format"), [RACE](https://buttercms.com/blog/chatgpt-prompt-frameworks/ "Role, Action, Context, Expectation"), [RISEN](https://www.transmedia.co.uk/article/a-beginners-guide-to-different-prompt-engineering-techniques "Role, Instructions, Steps, End goal, Narrowing (constraints)"), [RICECO](https://www.aifire.co/p/the-riceco-prompting-framework-a-guide-to-a-better-ai-prompt "Role, Instruction, Context, Examples, Constraints, Output Format"), [P.A.R.A](https://www.failfast.design/playground/prompt-engineering-5-chatgpt-frameworks "Problem, Action, Result, Alternative"), [COSTAR](https://medium.com/the-generator/the-perfect-prompt-prompt-engineering-cheat-sheet-d0b9c62a2bba "Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response") and so on, ad infinitum. All great stuff, we all love those neat little boxes where everything packs in nicely. The point is that when you have an intent, when you want to learn something from your personal oracle, behind the question you ask there's a lot you naturally leave unsaid or don't think through. You issue a command as if you're facing a smart person who doesn't need the obvious explained. Look at it differently. Imagine you're facing a deity that can do anything and knows everything. Except who it's talking to, and when. In fact, imagine that everything it knows is a text you sent via SMS from an unknown number. Straight into an inbox crammed with messages from every corner of the world, from people of every skin color, speaking every language on Earth, of every gender and personal pronoun that human creativity has ever spawned. Then you'll have a better grasp of the whole conundrum. Explain everything.

Lesson two. Not all words are born equal. Some are light, generic, and boring. "Yes." "How." Others are potent and dense, carrying very specific and deep meaning. "[Machiavellian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli "Machiavelli on Wikipedia")." "[Solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism "Solipsism on Wikipedia")." They work like an exquisitely crafted blade for carving probability out of the vast collection of information available to the model. Combine them and you'll get true gems of astonishing shapes. Try "[a very long sentence by a Machiavellian solipsist](https://chatgpt.com/?prompt=a%20very%20long%20sentence%20by%20a%20Machiavellian%20solipsist)" and savor the gorgeous diabolicalness of the response. Still, in practice I hope you won't reach for spells this strong. Choose your words carefully, go into the domain, go into the niche, summon the ghosts of the greats! Cast magic spells. 

Lesson three. Large language models are excellent teachers. Most of them also have access to the internet. It's a bit meta (and we know nobody likes [Meta](https://www.meta.com/ "The one whose domain we do not speak of")), but however strange it sounds, you can ask what to ask. Instead of "who is Richard Feynman," try "[how can I better ask a large language model 'who is Richard Feynman'](https://chatgpt.com/?prompt=how+can+I+better+ask+a+large+language+model+'who+is+Richard+Feynman')." Thank me later.

Oh, enough with the lessons already. Instead, to wrap up, try [Prompt Coach](https://borivojekovac.github.io/prompt-coach "Prompt Coach") - your personal trainer with a rent-a-brain. It's built to help you improve your prompts on your own, step by step, using [PMI prompting techniques](https://www.pmi.org/blog/how-to-write-better-prompts-framework "Building Blocks for Better Prompts: A Modular Prompt Engineering Framework on PMI.org"), and build an intuition for what a good prompt should look like, instead of memorizing silly acronyms. While the trainer itself is free, thinking costs - if you're paying for an OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or xAI account, [get yourself an API key](https://chatgpt.com?prompt=I%20need%20instructions%20on%20how%20to%20issue%20API%20key.%0A%0AYou%20need%20to%20ask%20me%20for%20which%20of%20these%20providers%20before%20you%20can%20provide%20guidance%3A%0A1.%20OpenAI%0A2.%20Anthropic%0A3.%20Google%0A4.%20xAI%0A%0AUpon%20clarifying%20vendor%2C%20you%20will%20research%20up-to-date%20instructions%20on%20how%20to%20obtain%20API%20key%2C%20and%20will%20then%20provide%20an%20easy%20to%20read%2C%20but%20comprehensive%20guide%20tailored%20for%20me.%0A%0AThe%20guide%20should%20be%20bulleted%2C%20step-by-step%20instructions%2C%20easy%20to%20follow%20and%20clean. "Instructions for obtaining an API key") and enter it in the app.

Who knows, if you persevere, maybe you too will become a wizard - as Sir Arthur C. Clarke once said - any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
