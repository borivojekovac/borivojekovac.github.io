# Zeitgeist: The Meter Runs

## GPT-5 lands as Europe's regulations bite, Meta writes a $14 billion check for superintelligence, and Google finally admits what a single prompt costs the planet. August is the month AI gets its first honest invoice.

The fifth generation arrives on August 7th, and the numbers read like coordinates to somewhere else entirely. [GPT-5 scores 94.6% on AIME 2025](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5/ "OpenAI GPT-5 announcement") - competition math that stumps most humans. [74.9% on SWE-bench Verified](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/08/gpt5-launch-analysis/ "InfoQ analysis of GPT-5 launch"), writing code that passes real-world tests. Sam Altman's livestream has the feel of a product launch and a weather report: this is what's coming, dress accordingly. But [InfoQ notes the shift](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/08/gpt5-commoditizing-costs/ "InfoQ on GPT-5 market dynamics") - costs are commoditizing, scrutiny rising. The frontier isn't lonely anymore.

Two weeks later, [DeepSeek drops V3.1](https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseek-v31-domestic-chips/ "Reuters on DeepSeek V3.1") from Beijing, MIT-licensed and optimized for domestic Chinese chips. The model runs on hardware Washington can't touch. Six months after DeepSeek's January shock sent Nvidia stock tumbling, [The Economist finds China pivoting](https://www.economist.com/china/2025/08/05/six-months-after-deepseek "The Economist on China's AI strategy") - less frontier research, more factory-floor deployment. [Bank of America forecasts $98 billion](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/china-ai-spending-forecast "SCMP on China AI spending") in Chinese AI capital expenditure for 2025. The race has two tracks now, running on different rails.

Five days before GPT-5's debut, [Europe's AI Act bites](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/02/eu-ai-act-gpai-provisions/ "TechCrunch on EU AI Act enforcement"). August 2nd brings mandatory documentation for every general-purpose model sold in the EU - training data, capabilities, limitations, all on file for regulators. [No delays, no transition periods](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/8/eu-ai-act-gpai-compliance "Greenberg Traurig on AI Act compliance"). OpenAI complies. Anthropic complies. The penalty regime remains theoretical - member states are still writing enforcement rules - but the precedent is set. AI now has paperwork.

In Menlo Park, Mark Zuckerberg reorganizes everything. [Meta Superintelligence Labs splits from the main AI division](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/meta-superintelligence-labs "New York Times on Meta restructuring") on August 19th - Alexandr Wang's new domain, now structurally separate from Meta's core AI research. Four groups emerge: fundamental research, product integration, infrastructure, and the moonshot division chasing capabilities that don't exist yet. The $14 billion hire from June now commands his own organization chart.

The same week, [Meta signals caution on open source](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/meta-open-source-shift "SCMP on Meta's open source shift"). The company that championed Llama now hedges - more "careful" going forward, executives say. China's embrace of open models has created uncomfortable optics. Your open-source gift to the world becomes someone else's strategic asset.

Meanwhile, the developers keep vibing. [TypeScript overtakes Python and JavaScript on GitHub](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/ "GitHub Blog on TypeScript") - 2.6 million monthly contributors, up 66% year-over-year. The rise isn't aesthetic preference; it's AI-driven. Static typing catches errors that language models miss. [Lovable hits $4 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/29/lovable-4-billion-valuation/ "TechCrunch on Lovable valuation"), eight months from launch to European AI royalty. Describe what you want, the machine writes the code. [80% of new GitHub developers use Copilot in their first week](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/new-developer-copilot-adoption/ "GitHub Blog on Copilot adoption"). The default has shifted.

Then Google breaks the silence everyone was waiting for. [The August 21st disclosure](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/21/1122288/google-gemini-ai-energy/ "MIT Technology Review on Google energy data") reveals what a Gemini prompt actually costs: 0.24 watt-hours median, roughly a microwave running for one second. The company claims [33-fold efficiency gains](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference "Google Cloud on AI environmental impact") over the past year. Researchers finally have real numbers from a major player - not the apocalyptic figures some predicted, but enough to do the math at scale. The Stargate initiative promises five gigawatts per data center. Multiply 0.24 watt-hours by a billion daily queries. The bottleneck has migrated from fabs to substations.

[Anthropic publishes its threat intelligence report](https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-countering-misuse-aug-2025 "Anthropic threat intelligence report") six days later - Claude enabling extortion operations, North Korean infiltration via fake IT workers, ransomware written by amateurs who couldn't code before. The company that talks most about safety now documents what happens when safety fails. The models are tools. Tools get used.

[Perplexity announces publisher revenue sharing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/perplexity-publisher-revenue-sharing "Bloomberg on Perplexity revenue model") as [Japanese newspapers file suit](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/perplexity-lawsuit-japan "Nikkei Asia on Perplexity lawsuit"). [51 copyright cases remain active](https://copyrightalliance.org/ai-litigation-tracker/ "Copyright Alliance litigation tracker"), discovery grinding forward, no verdicts expected until 2026. The legal system moves at human speed while the technology accelerates.

August 2025 delivers the invoice. The models are smarter - genuinely, measurably smarter. The regulations are real. The energy costs are quantified. And somewhere between GPT-5's benchmark scores and Google's watt-hour disclosures, the industry crosses into territory where the meter always runs.
