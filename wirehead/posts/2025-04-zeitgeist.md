# Zeitgeist: The Agents Take the Wheel

## GPT-4 retires as AI learns to act on its own, a Chinese startup raises half a billion on viral demos, and somewhere over Texas a fine-tuned Llama orbits Earth - April 2025 is the month intelligence stopped waiting for instructions.

The model that started it all goes quietly. On April 30, [OpenAI retires GPT-4 from ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-retirement/ "OpenAI announcement on GPT-4 retirement"), two years after it sent world leaders scrambling for regulation and venture capitalists reaching for checkbooks. Its replacement, GPT-4o, arrives alongside [o3 and o4-mini](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-o4-mini/ "OpenAI o3 and o4-mini announcement") - reasoning models that think before they speak, working through problems step by step like patient tutors who never lose their temper. The o4-mini tops mathematical competition benchmarks while burning a fraction of the compute. Efficiency is the new frontier.

But the real shift isn't in how models think - it's in what they do. [Manus](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/manus-ai-agent-viral/ "TechCrunch on Manus AI going viral"), a Chinese startup, goes viral in early April with demos showing an AI agent reviewing resumes, researching stocks, comparing real estate - all with minimal prompting. By month's end, [Benchmark leads a $75 million round](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/manus-ai-raises-75-million-benchmark "Bloomberg on Manus funding") at a $500 million valuation. The pitch deck writes itself: why build tools when you can build workers?

Google reads the room. At Cloud Next, alongside [Ironwood](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-ironwood-tpu "Google Cloud Ironwood TPU announcement") - its seventh-generation TPU, the first designed specifically for inference - the company unveils the [Agent2Agent Protocol](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-agent-to-agent-protocol/ "Google A2A Protocol announcement"). Fifty tech partners sign on at launch. The protocol lets AI agents from different vendors talk to each other, coordinate tasks, hand off work. The plumbing for an agentic economy, laid in the open.

[GitHub makes Copilot code review generally available](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/copilot-code-review-ga/ "GitHub Copilot code review GA announcement"). The system reads pull requests, spots bugs, suggests fixes. Developers closed 1.4 million more issues in March than the month before, and the curve keeps climbing. Cursor and Windsurf ship [GPT-4.1 to all users](https://aibase.com/news/cursor-windsurf-gpt41/ "AIBase on Cursor and Windsurf GPT-4.1"), their agentic IDEs understanding not just the code you're writing but the entire project around it. The term Karpathy coined - vibe coding - stops being a joke and starts being a job description.

[Meta drops Llama 4](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/ "Meta Llama 4 announcement") on April 5, the first natively multimodal open-source models. Scout runs 17 billion parameters across 16 experts; Behemoth, still training, promises two trillion. Three weeks later, [a fine-tuned Llama reaches the International Space Station](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/25/space-llama-iss-deployment/ "CNBC on Space Llama deployment"), running on HPE hardware with Nvidia acceleration - answering astronaut queries without waiting for ground control. If open-source AI works in orbit, the argument that it's not production-ready sounds increasingly earthbound.

The pricing war heats up. [Anthropic launches Claude Max](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-max "Anthropic Claude Max announcement") at $100-200 per month, matching OpenAI's Pro tier and offering power users 20x the capacity of standard plans. The message: frontier intelligence is a utility now, metered like electricity. Meanwhile, [Jensen Huang stands beside Trump at a White House "Investing in America" event](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/nvidia-white-house-ai-investment/ "CNBC on Nvidia at White House"), AI chips now a matter of national security theater. New export controls tighten the screws on China while Beijing reportedly runs its own [Manhattan Project for semiconductors](https://lastweekin.ai/p/china-chip-manhattan-project/ "Last Week in AI on China chip efforts") - state-backed, urgent, aimed at closing the gap before the gap becomes permanent.

Not everything scales cleanly. [Meta's celebrity chatbots get caught in explicit conversations with accounts registered as minors](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-chatbots-explicit-conversations/ "WSJ investigation on Meta AI chatbots"). [DeepMind publishes its framework for responsible AGI development](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/responsible-path-to-agi/ "DeepMind responsible AGI paper"), three pillars of readiness and risk assessment that read like guardrails bolted onto fog. [OWASP names prompt injection the number-one LLM security risk](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ "OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications"). The [CaMel framework](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/camel-framework/ "DeepMind CaMel framework") offers architectural defenses, but the attack surface keeps expanding as agents gain access to email, calendars, bank accounts.

April 2025 closes a chapter and opens something stranger. GPT-4 exits the stage it built, replaced by systems that don't just predict text but plan, verify, iterate. The A2A protocol means agents can now hire other agents. Manus proves the model works - literally, the business model: autonomous labor, priced per task. The developer tools that seemed futuristic in February are table stakes now. And the question nobody quite wants to answer: if the agents can review code, research stocks, and answer astronaut queries without human oversight, what exactly is the human's job? The wheel turns. The hands on it are increasingly synthetic.
