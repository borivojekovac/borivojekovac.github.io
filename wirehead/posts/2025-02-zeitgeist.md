# Zeitgeist: The Reasoning Cascade

## February 2025 marked the moment when artificial reasoning escaped the lab and became ambient infrastructure - a month when thinking machines stopped being exclusive and started being everywhere.

The tremor began in January. [DeepSeek's R1 model](https://time.com/7341939/ai-developments-2025-trump-china/) dropped like a stone through Silicon Valley's assumptions, achieving reasoning parity at a fraction of Western costs and [wiping half a trillion from Nvidia's market cap](https://time.com/7341939/ai-developments-2025-trump-china/). The Chinese lab had cracked the code on cheap cognition, then given it away. Open-source meant anyone could download and dissect what had been proprietary magic. The message was clear: intelligence was no longer America's monopoly.

February became the aftershock month, when the implications cascaded through every layer of the AI stack. [OpenAI released o3-mini to free users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o3) on January 31, democratizing what the labs call "thinking" - those hidden chains of reasoning that let models pause, reconsider, iterate. No longer the exclusive domain of paying customers, the ability to watch machines deliberate became as common as autocomplete. The cognitive gap between human and artificial reasoning narrowed not through breakthrough but through democratisation.

The reasoning revolution materialized as product. [OpenAI's Deep Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o3) launched February 2, an agent that could generate comprehensive reports in minutes, not hours. Web searches became reasoning chains became structured knowledge. The research assistant materialized as infrastructure, another layer in the stack between human curiosity and synthesized understanding. Information work began its next phase of automation.

By February 6, transparency pressure forced [OpenAI to expose more of the thought processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_o3). The black box cracked open, revealing the mechanical poetry of artificial deliberation. Users could peer into the reasoning chains, watch models argue with themselves, see the cognitive scaffolding that supported each conclusion. What had been opaque became observable, though not necessarily comprehensible.

The infrastructure beneath this reasoning revolution strained under unprecedented demand. [AI companies approached $1 trillion in infrastructure commitments](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/big-funding-trends-charts-eoy-2025/), with [58% of funding concentrated in megarounds of $500 million or more](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/big-funding-trends-charts-eoy-2025/). The circular economy of AI investment - startups funded by chip makers, then purchasing chips from those same funders - created what observers called ["the first bubble that combines all the components of all prior bubbles"](https://time.com/7341939/ai-developments-2025-trump-china/).

Yet the money followed the momentum. [Enterprise AI revenue hit $37 billion](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/big-funding-trends-charts-eoy-2025/), tripling year-over-year as reasoning models found purchase in business workflows. The technology moved from demonstration to deployment, from proof-of-concept to profit center. Intelligence became a service layer, reasoning a commodity.

China's open-source strategy represented more than technical competition. It was cultural warfare through code distribution, soft power exercised through model weights. The [U.S. response](https://time.com/7341939/ai-developments-2025-trump-china/) involved relaxing export restrictions and accelerating domestic development, but the damage to American AI supremacy assumptions had been done. The geopolitical order was rewriting itself in Python and CUDA.

February's lesson crystallized: reasoning isn't revolutionary when it's exclusive, only when it's everywhere. The month marked not AI's cognitive breakthrough but its cognitive democratization. The thinking machines had arrived not with fanfare but with free accounts and API endpoints. Intelligence became ambient, reasoning became routine, and the future arrived wearing the clothes of a software update.

The cascade had begun - from DeepSeek's disruption to OpenAI's response to a trillion-dollar infrastructure race. February 2025 was when artificial reasoning stopped being a premium feature and became basic infrastructure. The age of thinking as a service had quietly begun.
