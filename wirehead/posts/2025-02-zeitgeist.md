# Zeitgeist: The Arms Race Goes Vertical

## Every major lab ships a frontier model in three weeks, AI learns to write its own code, and half a trillion dollars starts pouring into concrete and silicon - February 2025 is the month intelligence becomes infrastructure.

The aftershock from Hangzhou keeps reverberating. DeepSeek's R1 sits atop the US App Store charts while [CSIS analysts parse what it means](https://www.csis.org/analysis/deepseeks-latest-breakthrough-redefining-ai-race "CSIS analysis of DeepSeek's impact") - not a Sputnik moment, they conclude, but something more unsettling: proof that export controls can accelerate innovation rather than contain it. The $5.6 million training bill becomes a talking point in boardrooms and congressional hearings alike. If algorithmic cleverness substitutes for compute, what exactly are those chip restrictions protecting?

The American labs respond with a synchronized barrage. [Google makes Gemini 2.0 generally available](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/ "Google's Gemini 2.0 announcement") on February 5th, its two-million-token context window doubling the competition. [xAI drops Grok 3](https://x.ai/news/grok-3 "xAI Grok 3 announcement") on the 17th, trained with ten times the compute of its predecessors. [Anthropic unveils Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet "Anthropic Claude 3.7 announcement") on the 24th - the first hybrid reasoning model, toggling between quick responses and extended thinking. [OpenAI caps the month with GPT-4.5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/ "OpenAI GPT-4.5 announcement") on the 27th, a $75-per-million-tokens behemoth trading raw capability for emotional intelligence. Four frontier models in twenty-three days. The monoculture is dead; each lab now chases a different vision of what intelligence should be.

But the real story is what these models can do with code. Andrej Karpathy coins the term that captures the moment: [vibe coding](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/vibe-coding-is-the-new-way-to-build-software-according-to-ai-pioneer-andrej-karpathy/ "Ars Technica on vibe coding"). You describe what you want, accept what the machine produces, run it until it works. [Claude Code ships as Anthropic's first agentic tool](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code "Anthropic Claude Code announcement"), operating from the terminal, searching repositories, editing files, pushing commits to GitHub. Early testers report 45-minute tasks completed in single passes. [Google makes Gemini Code Assist free](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-code-assist-is-now-free-for-all-developers/ "Google Gemini Code Assist free announcement"), commoditizing what was premium six months ago. The IDE wars intensify as Cursor and Windsurf reimagine development environments around AI-first workflows. The developer becomes a director, not a typist.

The agents keep multiplying. [OpenAI expands Operator internationally](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/openai-expands-operator-to-more-countries/ "TechCrunch on Operator expansion"), its browser-controlling system now clicking through interfaces across a dozen countries. [Google announces an AI Co-Scientist](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-ai-co-scientist/ "Google AI Co-Scientist announcement") that generates hypotheses and research plans. [Hugging Face releases Open Deep Research](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research "Hugging Face Open Deep Research"), democratizing autonomous research capabilities. The pattern is unmistakable: AI is learning to act, not just answer.

Meanwhile, the physical layer expands at industrial scale. [Nvidia reports $39.3 billion in quarterly revenue](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2025 "Nvidia Q4 FY2025 earnings"), up 78% year-over-year. [SoftBank finalizes terms for a $40 billion OpenAI investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/softbank-finalizing-40-billion-investment-in-openai.html "CNBC on SoftBank-OpenAI deal") at a $260 billion valuation. The Stargate project moves from announcement to site selection, its $500 billion promise translating into concrete foundations across Texas. Power companies report unprecedented demand, wait times stretching to years. The constraint isn't silicon anymore - it's electricity.

The [EU AI Act's first prohibitions take effect](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ai-act-implementation-timeline/ "EU AI Act implementation timeline") on February 2nd, banning social scoring and certain surveillance applications. [Thomson Reuters wins a key ruling](https://ipwatchdog.com/2025/02/11/judge-bibas-issues-ruling-thomson-reuters-v-ross-intelligence/ "IPWatchdog on Thomson Reuters v. ROSS") in its copyright case against ROSS Intelligence, the legal system slowly parsing what training on the internet actually means. [Workday announces 1,750 layoffs](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/workday-to-cut-1750-jobs-as-it-prioritizes-ai-investments.html "CNBC on Workday layoffs") to prioritize AI investment - one of the first major companies to explicitly cite AI as the reason for workforce reduction.

February 2025 feels like watching a phase transition. The models ship faster than anyone can evaluate them. The agents learn to browse, code, and research. The infrastructure gets poured at a pace that assumes AI will be as fundamental as electricity. And somewhere in the gap between DeepSeek's efficiency and Stargate's scale, two futures are being built simultaneously - one where intelligence is cheap and distributed, another where it requires nation-state capital to compete. The race isn't slowing down. It's going vertical.
