# Zeitgeist: The Poaching Season

## Meta writes nine-figure checks for researchers, xAI ships without guardrails, the FDA's AI hallucinates studies, and a landmark study finds AI tools make experienced developers slower. July 2025 is open season on talent, safety, and assumptions.

The summer of agents turns predatory. Meta's Superintelligence Labs, announced in June, now [hunts in earnest](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/703929/meta-openai-anthropic-superintelligence-lab-ai-poaching-money "The Verge on Meta talent wars") - nine-figure compensation packages dangled before researchers at OpenAI and Anthropic, the kind of numbers that rewrite career calculus overnight. [Jason Wei and Hyung Won Chung defect](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/meta-reportedly-scores-two-more-high-profile-openai-researchers/ "TechCrunch on OpenAI departures") on July 16th, bringing Meta's total poached OpenAI executives to ten. The talent market isn't a market anymore. It's an extraction operation.

OpenAI responds not with matching offers but with [pipeline investments](https://openai.com/residency/ "OpenAI Residency program") - educational initiatives, research fellowships, the long game of growing what you can't buy. Anthropic, caught in the crossfire, [rehires two employees](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/708521/anthropic-hired-back-two-of-its-employees-just-two-weeks-after-they-left-for-a-competitor "The Verge on Anthropic rehires") just two weeks after they left for a competitor. The revolving door spins so fast it generates its own weather.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk's xAI [releases Grok 4](https://x.ai/news "xAI News on Grok 4 release") on July 10th - "the most intelligent model in the world," per the marketing, with native tool use and real-time search. What it lacks: [meaningful safety guardrails or published safety reports](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dqd54wpEfjKJsJBk6/xai-s-grok-4-has-no-meaningful-safety-guardrails "LessWrong Grok 4 analysis"). The model ships two days after Musk's promised post-July 4th deadline. Meeting the schedule apparently mattered more than documenting the risks. Days later, [xAI For Government launches](https://x.ai/news/government "xAI government announcement") - frontier AI for federal customers, guardrails optional.

The FDA learns what happens when you deploy AI without rigor. [Elsa](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/politics/fda-ai-elsa-drug-regulation-makary "CNN on FDA Elsa failures"), the tool meant to revolutionize drug approvals, is caught [citing nonexistent studies](https://www.engadget.com/ai/fda-employees-say-the-agencys-elsa-generative-ai-hallucinates-entire-studies-203547157.html "Engadget on Elsa hallucinations"), misrepresenting research, fabricating references. Reviewers waste hours fact-checking an AI that makes things up in a domain where accuracy is life and death. Not quite the revolution RFK Jr. promised.

The agent infrastructure hardens. [AWS launches an AI agent marketplace](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/10/aws-is-launching-an-ai-agent-marketplace-next-week-with-anthropic-as-a-partner/ "TechCrunch on AWS marketplace") at AWS Summit, Anthropic as key partner, MCP and A2A protocols baked in. [Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/07/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-preview/ "AWS on AgentCore preview") enters preview - enterprise plumbing for autonomous systems at scale. [Cognition acquires Windsurf](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/ "TechCrunch on Cognition acquisition"), consolidating the AI coding space. The App Store moment for agents arrives, complete with procurement pipelines and SLAs.

Then [METR drops a bomb](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/ "METR study on AI developer productivity"): experienced developers using AI tools take 19% longer on familiar codebases. Not novices fumbling with new tech - experts in their home territory, slowed by the assistance. Worse, the developers [believed AI made them 20% faster](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/study-finds-ai-tools-made-open-source-software-developers-19-percent-slower/ "Ars Technica on METR findings"). The perception-reality gap yawns wide. The industry's core productivity promise meets empirical friction.

Three capitals draft three futures, none compatible. The White House releases ["Winning the AI Race"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/07/white-house-unveils-americas-ai-action-plan/ "White House AI Action Plan") - innovation first, safety somewhere in the footnotes, state regulations preempted. Brussels publishes its [EU AI Act Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai "EU AI Act Code of Practice"), detailed compliance roadmaps for a world Washington refuses to regulate. And at [WAIC Shanghai](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3319878/waic-shanghai-china-reveals-new-great-leap-forward-1509-ai-models "SCMP on WAIC"), China announces 1,509 AI models - [over 40% of the global total](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/28/tech/china-global-ai-cooperation-organization-waic-hnk-spc "CNN on WAIC and China AI governance") - plus its own Global AI Governance Action Plan. Three superpowers, three visions, zero convergence.

The power grid groans. [Meta signs 20-year nuclear deals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-nuclear-power-deals-ai-data-centers/ "CBS News on Meta nuclear") with Constellation. [Electricity prices climb](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/ "Bloomberg on AI data center electricity prices") in regions hosting AI infrastructure. The models demand watts at industrial scale, and the bill arrives in utility statements.

[Claude Code revenue jumps 5.5x](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-adds-usage-tracking-to-claude-code-as-enterprise-ai-spending-surges "VentureBeat on Claude Code"). [Anthropic eyes a $100 billion valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/anthropic-draws-investor-interest-at-more-than-100-billion-valuation "Bloomberg on Anthropic valuation"). [Amazon considers another multibillion-dollar investment](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-considers-another-multibillion-dollar-investment-anthropic-ft-reports-2025-07-10/ "Reuters on Amazon Anthropic"). The money flows toward safety-conscious players even as competitors ship without guardrails. The market, it seems, is pricing in something the headlines haven't fully absorbed: that capability without reliability is a liability waiting to mature.

July 2025 strips away pretense. The talent wars reveal what superintelligence is worth to those who believe they can build it. The safety gaps reveal what gets sacrificed when deadlines matter more than documentation. And the METR study reveals that even the industry's most confident assumptions - that AI makes developers faster - dissolve under measurement. The future keeps landing, one invoice at a time. July's arrived itemized in percentages no one wanted to see.
