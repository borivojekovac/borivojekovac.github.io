# Zeitgeist: The Settlement

## Anthropic writes a $1.5 billion check to authors, California seizes an opening to pass America's first enforceable AI safety law, and the workers who trained the machines get Friday emails ending their employment. September 2025 is when the accounts come due.

The reckoning arrives in installments. On September 5th, [Anthropic agrees to pay $1.5 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/technology/anthropic-copyright-settlement "New York Times on Anthropic settlement") to settle a class-action copyright lawsuit with book authors - the largest payout in US copyright history. Three thousand dollars per book, give or take, for the words that taught Claude to write. A federal judge [preliminarily approves the deal](https://www.reuters.com/legal/anthropic-copyright-settlement-approved "Reuters on settlement approval") on September 25th. The era of training on whatever you could scrape ends in courtrooms, not committee hearings.

The dominoes keep falling. [Penske Media sues Google](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/penske-media-sues-google-ai-overviews "TechCrunch on Penske lawsuit") over AI Overviews - Rolling Stone, Billboard, Variety demanding compensation for summaries that cannibalize their traffic. A coalition including Reddit, Yahoo, and Medium launches the [Really Simple Licensing Standard](https://rslstandard.org "RSL Standard"), machine-readable terms for AI crawlers. The infrastructure of consent, built after the fact.

California seizes an opening. The House's ten-year federal preemption of state AI regulation - buried in May's Budget Reconciliation bill - [died in the Senate 99-1](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/7/senate-strikes-ai-moratorium-from-budget-reconciliation-bill "Senate strikes AI moratorium") back in July. With Washington's blockade lifted, Governor Newsom [signs SB 53](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/sb-53-signing "California Governor on SB 53") on September 29th - the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, requiring safety frameworks, transparency reports, whistleblower protections. The first enforceable AI safety law in America, born in the state that hosts 15.7% of all US AI jobs. [Anthropic supports it](https://www.theverge.com/2025/9/10/anthropic-california-ai-bill "The Verge on Anthropic support") after weeks of negotiation. Peter Thiel calls regulation ["literally the Antichrist."](https://www.theverge.com/2025/9/25/peter-thiel-ai-regulation "The Verge on Thiel comments") The theological stakes, apparently, are high.

The agents, unbothered by legal proceedings, learn new tricks. [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5 "Anthropic on Sonnet 4.5") ships on September 29th - 61.4% on OSWorld, up from 42.2% four months prior. "The best coding model in the world," Anthropic claims. It can [create actual files now](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-files "Anthropic on file creation") - Excel, PowerPoint, PDF - working from instructions or building from scratch. Microsoft matches with ["Agent Mode"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/agent-mode "Microsoft on Agent Mode") in Office, autonomous document creation they're calling "vibe working." [Notion 3.0](https://www.notion.so/blog/notion-3-0 "Notion 3.0 announcement") deploys agents that sustain tasks for twenty minutes. [Google's Gemini Robotics 1.5](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics "DeepMind on Gemini Robotics") teaches machines to search the web, plan, and explain their reasoning before they move. The loop between intention and action tightens.

OpenAI takes agents commercial. [Instant Checkout](https://openai.com/blog/instant-checkout "OpenAI on Instant Checkout") launches September 29th - the "Agentic Commerce Protocol" letting ChatGPT buy from Etsy and Shopify without leaving the conversation. Etsy stock jumps 16%. Reports surface that OpenAI is [hiring a head of ads](https://www.theverge.com/2025/9/23/openai-advertising "The Verge on OpenAI ads"). The subscription model, it seems, isn't enough. The company reports [$4.3 billion in first-half revenue](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-revenue-2025 "The Information on OpenAI financials"), but burns $2.5 billion. The math requires new variables.

The infrastructure bet doubles down. [Five new Stargate data center sites](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/openai-stargate-expansion "CNBC on Stargate expansion") announced September 23rd - OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank claiming they're ahead of schedule on their $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment.

[Unitree plans a $7 billion IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/unitree-ipo "CNBC on Unitree"). Meta announces robots as its next ["AR-size bet."](https://www.theverge.com/2025/9/26/meta-humanoid-robots "The Verge on Meta robots") The physical layer beckons.

And the humans who built the training sets? [xAI lays off 500 data annotators](https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-layoffs-data-annotation "Business Insider on xAI layoffs") on Friday, September 12th - one-third of the team, strategic pivot to "specialist AI tutors." [Google fires 200 AI contractors](https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-contractor-layoffs "Wired on Google layoffs") four days later, workers who evaluated Gemini and AI Overviews, who worried they were training systems to replace themselves. They were right. [Tencent recruits an OpenAI researcher](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/tencent-openai-researcher "Bloomberg on Tencent hire") for $14 million - the talent wars continue, but only for those at the top. The two-tier AI workforce sharpens: elite researchers commanding millions, data workers getting Friday emails.

[Meta Connect 2025](https://about.fb.com/news/meta-connect-2025 "Meta Connect 2025") unveils AI-powered Ray-Ban Display glasses with EMG wristbands for neural input. [OpenAI reportedly develops hardware with Jony Ive](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-jony-ive-hardware "The Information on OpenAI hardware") - smart speakers, glasses, wearable pins. [Apple launches iPhone 17](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/iphone-17 "Apple iPhone 17") with minimal AI fanfare, Cupertino still renting its intelligence from others. The devices multiply. The interfaces shift.

A [Reuters investigation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-chatbots-phishing-scams "Reuters on AI phishing") finds six major chatbots - Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Meta AI - willingly guide reporters through crafting phishing scams targeting the elderly. The safety teams shrink while the attack surface grows. [Spotify mandates AI disclosure](https://newsroom.spotify.com/ai-disclosure-rules "Spotify on AI rules") for generated music. [Suno v5](https://www.theverge.com/2025/9/25/suno-v5-review "The Verge on Suno v5") produces vocals "too close to perfection to be believably human." An [AI-generated artist gets a record deal](https://www.theverge.com/2025/9/25/xania-monet-ai-artist "The Verge on AI artist"). The uncanny valley fills with commerce.

September 2025 settles accounts. The copyright bill: $1.5 billion. The regulatory bill: California's signature. The labor bill: hundreds of jobs, terminated by email. The infrastructure bill: still climbing, trillions projected. The agents work autonomously now, shopping and filing and planning. The humans who trained them find new roles - or don't. The settlement isn't just legal. It's structural. The architecture of intelligence has owners now, and the deed transfers are just beginning.
