# The Legal Reckoning: AI Faces Regulation and Copyright Reality

*As US states introduce hundreds of AI bills and courts rule against fair use defenses, March 2025 marked the moment AI's legal framework began to crystallize—with profound implications for the industry.*

## A Flood of State Legislation

By early March 2025, US lawmakers had already introduced hundreds of AI-related bills across the states. TechCrunch reported on March 7th that the legislative activity reflected "both urgency and bipartisan interest" in AI governance. According to NCSL tracking, more than 1,080 AI-related bills would be introduced across all 50 states by year's end.

The bills covered remarkable breadth. Maryland's H.B. 1331 proposed regulating the development and use of "high-risk AI in consequential decisions." Texas introduced the expansive "Texas Responsible AI Governance Act." Massachusetts' HD 3750 would require healthcare insurance providers to disclose the use of AI in coverage decisions.

This state-level activity emerged in the absence of comprehensive federal AI legislation. As the Cimplifi analysis noted, "the patchwork of state AI laws is rapidly expanding in the absence of overarching federal regulation." For AI companies, this created a compliance challenge: potentially 50 different regulatory frameworks to navigate.

## The EU AI Act Takes Effect

Across the Atlantic, the EU AI Act's provisions on prohibited AI practices came into force in early 2025. The Act represents the world's most comprehensive AI regulation, establishing categories of risk and corresponding requirements for AI systems.

The prohibited practices provisions ban AI systems deemed to pose unacceptable risks—including social scoring systems, real-time biometric identification in public spaces (with limited exceptions), and AI that exploits vulnerabilities of specific groups. Market surveillance authorities were tasked with enforcement, with designation deadlines set for August 2025.

For global AI companies, the EU AI Act created extraterritorial obligations. Any AI system deployed to EU users falls under its jurisdiction, regardless of where the company is headquartered. The Act's influence extended beyond Europe, as companies began designing AI systems to meet EU standards by default.

Inside Tech Law's March analysis noted that while enforcement wouldn't begin immediately, "once market surveillance authorities have been designated, they will be able to impose penalties relating to non-compliance from 2 February 2025." The regulatory clock was ticking.

## Thomson Reuters vs. Ross Intelligence: A Landmark Ruling

The most consequential legal development of March 2025 came from the courts rather than legislatures. A federal court ruled against Ross Intelligence's fair use defense in its long-running copyright dispute with Thomson Reuters—a decision with profound implications for AI training practices.

Ross Intelligence had built an AI-driven legal research tool to compete with Thomson Reuters' Westlaw. After Thomson Reuters refused to license its content, Ross obtained "Bulk Memos" generated from Westlaw's copyrighted headnotes and used them in its training pipeline.

The court's ruling, as analyzed by Reed Smith, "highlights the copyright infringement risks of using third-party materials to train, develop, improve or operate AI tools." The fair use defense—long assumed by many AI companies to protect training on copyrighted data—had failed in a concrete case.

IP Watchdog described the ruling as one of "three key decisions on AI training and copyrighted content" in 2025, noting that courts were "finally beginning to confront the substantive merits of plaintiffs' infringement claims and defendants' fair use defenses."

## The Copyright Litigation Explosion

The Thomson Reuters ruling was just one front in a broader legal war. Debevoise reported tracking more than 50 active lawsuits between intellectual property holders and AI companies. The Copyright Alliance documented this as part of a year in which "hypothetical AI risks became operational reality."

The music industry proved particularly aggressive. AI music platforms Suno and Udio faced ongoing copyright battles with major labels. By year's end, Suno would agree to a $500 million settlement with Warner Music Group, fundamentally reshaping the AI-generated music landscape. Billboard reported that Udio was "pivoting away from being a service that generates wholly new songs" toward a more restricted model.

For AI companies, the message was clear: the era of training on whatever data could be scraped from the internet was ending. Licensing, permissions, and careful documentation of training data provenance were becoming legal necessities.

## Authors Fight Back

Individual creators joined the fray. Publishers Weekly reported that six authors who opted out of a proposed Anthropic settlement filed individual lawsuits against Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity AI. They sought $150,000 for each title from each defendant under the Copyright Act.

The lawsuits reflected growing frustration among creators who felt their work had been used without permission or compensation to train AI systems that now competed with them. The legal theory—that training constitutes copying, and copying without permission constitutes infringement—was being tested across multiple jurisdictions.

## Regulatory Fragmentation

The combination of state legislation, EU regulation, and court rulings created a complex compliance landscape. AI companies faced:

- **50 potential state frameworks** in the US, each with different requirements
- **EU AI Act obligations** for any systems serving European users  
- **Copyright litigation risk** for training data practices
- **Sector-specific rules** in healthcare, finance, and other regulated industries

The Manatt analysis of "AI Wrapped 2025" noted that "despite jurisdictional differences, 2025 legislation and enforcement activity repeatedly converged around a common set of risk areas." Healthcare AI, employment decisions, and consumer-facing applications faced particular scrutiny.

## Industry Response

AI companies began adapting. OpenAI and Anthropic implemented age prediction and teen safety measures, anticipating regulatory requirements. Enterprise AI platforms emphasized compliance features and audit trails. Training data practices became more transparent—or at least more carefully documented.

The Stanford HAI AI Index Report, released in March, provided data showing that AI regulation was accelerating globally. The report documented the shift from voluntary guidelines to binding requirements, from industry self-regulation to government oversight.

## What It Means

March 2025 marked the end of AI's regulatory honeymoon. The industry that had grown up in a largely unregulated environment now faced a thicket of legal requirements and litigation risks.

For AI developers, the implications are practical: training data must be licensed or clearly fair use; deployment in regulated sectors requires compliance infrastructure; and the assumption that innovation moves faster than regulation no longer holds.

For users and society, the regulatory reckoning offers both protection and uncertainty. The rules being written now will shape AI development for decades. Whether they strike the right balance between innovation and safety remains the central question of AI governance.
