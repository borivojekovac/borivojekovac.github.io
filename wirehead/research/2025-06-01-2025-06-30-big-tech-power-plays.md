# Big Tech's AI Power Plays: Superintelligence Ambitions and the Talent Wars

*June 2025 | Wirehead Research*

## The Superintelligence Race Intensifies

June 2025 witnessed a dramatic escalation in Big Tech's AI ambitions. Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta Superintelligence Labs and made the most expensive talent acquisition in AI history. OpenAI's ChatGPT hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue. And across the industry, companies poured unprecedented capital into AI infrastructure. The message was clear: the race to artificial general intelligence—and beyond—has entered a new phase.

## Meta's Superintelligence Gambit

The month's most dramatic development came from Meta. Mark Zuckerberg, reportedly dissatisfied with Llama 4's performance following its April release, announced the formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL)—a new division dedicated to artificial superintelligence research.

The announcement signaled a strategic pivot. While Meta had previously positioned itself as the champion of open-source AI through its Llama models, the superintelligence push suggested the company might keep its most advanced AI closed. Zuckerberg later confirmed this, indicating that Meta "likely won't open source all of its superintelligence AI models."

To lead this effort, Meta made a stunning move: hiring Scale AI founder and CEO Alexandr Wang as its first-ever Chief AI Officer. The deal, reportedly worth nearly $15 billion including the acquisition of key Scale AI talent, represented one of the largest AI talent acquisitions ever.

Wang, who founded Scale AI at age 19 and built it into a data labeling powerhouse valued at over $13 billion, brought both technical expertise and operational experience to Meta. His mandate: shape Meta's AI vision and drive strategic initiatives from concept to execution.

The hire also reflected the intensifying competition for AI talent. With a limited pool of researchers and engineers capable of pushing the frontier, companies are willing to pay extraordinary sums to secure leadership. Meta's willingness to spend $15 billion on a single hire—more than many companies' entire AI budgets—illustrated just how high the stakes have become.

## OpenAI's Commercial Juggernaut

While Meta made headlines with its superintelligence ambitions, OpenAI demonstrated the commercial potential of current AI capabilities. By June 2025, ChatGPT had reached $10 billion in annual recurring revenue—a remarkable achievement for a product that launched just two and a half years earlier.

The numbers told a story of explosive growth:
- 800 million weekly active users
- 5.6 billion monthly visits
- 34% of US adults reporting ChatGPT usage
- Ranking as the 6th most visited website globally

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman keynoted Snowflake Summit 2025 in early June, discussing the future of AI and data innovation. His presence at a major enterprise conference underscored OpenAI's evolution from research lab to commercial powerhouse.

The company also continued its product development, launching ChatGPT Record for Team users—a feature that transcribes voice recordings and transforms them into actionable outputs. The Advanced Voice Mode received upgrades for more natural, emotionally aware conversations. These incremental improvements, multiplied across hundreds of millions of users, drove continued engagement and revenue growth.

## The Infrastructure Arms Race

Behind the AI capabilities making headlines, an infrastructure arms race was underway. The capital expenditures reported by major tech companies in June revealed the scale of investment:

**Meta**: $17 billion in Q2 2025 capital expenditures, primarily for AI data centers and infrastructure.

**Microsoft**: $24.2 billion for the quarter ending in June, with AI infrastructure as a major component.

**Amazon**: Announced $15 billion investment in Northern Virginia data centers alone.

These numbers represent just a fraction of total AI infrastructure spending across the industry. NVIDIA's announcement of the Rubin platform—featuring six new AI chips designed for rack-scale supercomputing—highlighted the hardware demands driving this investment.

The infrastructure buildout has consequences beyond corporate balance sheets. Google's 2025 Environmental Report revealed continued increases in carbon emissions driven by AI expansion. Data center energy consumption is straining power grids in some regions, with reports of rising electricity prices in areas with heavy data center concentration.

## The Talent Battlefield

The Wang acquisition was the most visible example of intensifying AI talent competition, but it wasn't isolated. Across the industry, companies were aggressively recruiting—and defending against poaching.

The dynamics are straightforward: AI capabilities depend heavily on a relatively small number of researchers and engineers with frontier expertise. Training a state-of-the-art model requires not just compute and data, but people who understand how to architect, train, and refine these systems. That expertise is scarce and highly mobile.

Companies are responding with:

**Compensation escalation**: Base salaries, bonuses, and equity packages for top AI talent have reached levels that would have seemed absurd just a few years ago.

**Retention packages**: Companies are offering substantial incentives to keep key employees from departing to competitors or starting their own ventures.

**Acqui-hires**: Rather than recruiting individuals, companies are acquiring entire teams or small companies to secure talent.

**Research partnerships**: Academic collaborations provide access to emerging talent and research capabilities.

The talent wars have implications for AI development trajectories. Companies that secure the best researchers may pull ahead; those that lose key people may fall behind. The concentration of talent at a handful of well-funded organizations raises questions about the diversity of AI development approaches.

## Platform Power Consolidation

June also revealed how AI is reshaping platform dynamics. Several developments illustrated the trend:

**Reddit's AI pivot**: Celebrating its 20th anniversary, Reddit announced major AI integration plans, building on licensing deals with Google and OpenAI. The platform's vast archive of human conversation has become valuable training data, transforming Reddit from a social network into an AI data supplier.

**AI-powered search disruption**: Reports showed AI-powered search results increasingly replacing traditional news clicks, with users obtaining information directly from AI rather than visiting source websites. This shift threatens the traffic-based business models of publishers and content creators.

**Anthropic's platform control**: Anthropic began enforcing restrictions on unauthorized Claude usage by third-party tools, asserting control over how its models are deployed. The crackdown highlighted the power AI model providers hold over the ecosystem of applications built on their technology.

## Privacy Boundaries Tested

Meta's request for access to users' unpublished camera roll photos for AI features illustrated how companies are pushing privacy boundaries in pursuit of AI capabilities.

The feature, which appeared when users created Facebook Stories, asked permission for "cloud processing" to generate creative suggestions from photos not yet uploaded to Facebook. While users could decline, the request represented an expansion of AI data collection into previously private spaces.

The move sparked privacy concerns. Meta's AI Terms of Service allow the company to analyze media and facial features. For users who chose Apple specifically for its privacy-focused approach, Meta's aggressive data collection presented a stark contrast.

## Regulatory Responses

The aggressive AI expansion prompted regulatory responses. The New York state legislature passed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act in June, establishing comprehensive regulation for frontier AI models. The law, later signed by Governor Hochul, made New York the second US state after California to enact such legislation.

In Europe, over 30 startup founders and investors published an open letter calling for the EU to pause AI Act implementation. They argued that incomplete regulations and unclear compliance requirements were creating uncertainty that could drive AI innovation to other jurisdictions.

The regulatory landscape remains fragmented, with different approaches in the US, EU, UK, and China. For global AI companies, navigating this patchwork of requirements adds complexity and cost to operations.

## What It Means

The developments of June 2025 revealed an AI industry in hypergrowth, with major players making massive bets on the technology's future. Several themes emerged:

**Concentration is increasing**: The resources required for frontier AI development—talent, compute, data, capital—are concentrating at a handful of well-funded organizations. Smaller players face growing barriers to competition.

**Commercial viability is proven**: ChatGPT's $10 billion ARR demonstrates that AI products can generate substantial revenue. This commercial success will attract more investment and competition.

**Infrastructure is the bottleneck**: The limiting factor for AI development is increasingly physical—chips, data centers, power. Companies that secure infrastructure advantages may pull ahead.

**Privacy norms are shifting**: The boundaries of acceptable data collection for AI are being tested and expanded. Users face difficult tradeoffs between AI capabilities and privacy.

**Regulation is coming**: Governments are responding to AI's rapid advance with new laws and requirements. Companies must prepare for a more regulated future.

The power plays of June 2025 set the stage for an even more competitive landscape ahead. The companies that emerge as AI leaders will shape not just the technology industry, but increasingly, the broader economy and society.
