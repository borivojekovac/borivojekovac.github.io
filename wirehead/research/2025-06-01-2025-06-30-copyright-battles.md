# AI Copyright Battles Heat Up: Fair Use, Settlements, and Hollywood's Counterattack

*June 2025 | Wirehead Research*

## The Legal Reckoning Arrives

June 2025 delivered a series of landmark developments in the ongoing legal war between AI companies and content creators. Federal courts issued significant rulings on fair use, major entertainment companies launched new lawsuits, and the contours of a post-training-data legal landscape began to emerge. For AI developers and creative industries alike, the month made clear that the era of consequence-free training on copyrighted content is ending.

## The Transformative Use Question

The most consequential legal development came in the Bartz v. Anthropic case, where a federal judge ruled that using books to train AI could constitute "transformative" fair use—a finding that, if upheld, could provide significant legal cover for AI training practices.

The case, filed by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, alleged that Anthropic downloaded over 7 million books from pirate sites like LibGen to train its Claude models. The plaintiffs initially attacked the entire practice of using copyrighted works for AI training.

But the June ruling suggested a more nuanced legal framework. The court found that AI training could be transformative because the resulting model doesn't simply reproduce the original works—it creates something fundamentally new. This reasoning echoes the logic applied in earlier cases involving search engines and book digitization projects.

The ruling didn't end the case. Questions remained about whether Anthropic's specific practices—particularly the use of pirated copies—crossed legal lines regardless of the transformative use analysis. The case would later settle for a landmark sum, but the June ruling established important precedent for how courts might evaluate AI training more broadly.

## Meta Prevails Against Authors

On June 25, Meta won a significant victory when a federal judge ruled in its favor against a group of authors who claimed the company used their books without permission to train AI. The court found that Meta's use qualified as fair use, rejecting the authors' infringement claims.

The ruling reinforced the emerging judicial consensus that AI training on copyrighted works may be legally permissible under certain circumstances. For Meta, which has positioned its Llama models as open-source alternatives to proprietary systems, the victory provided crucial legal validation for its training practices.

But the ruling came with important caveats. Courts have emphasized that fair use analysis is highly fact-specific, and different circumstances—different types of content, different uses of trained models, different commercial contexts—might yield different results.

## Hollywood Strikes Back

While AI companies celebrated their legal victories, the entertainment industry launched a major counteroffensive. On June 23, Disney and Universal filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Midjourney, the AI image generator known for producing high-quality visual content.

The lawsuit marked a significant escalation in entertainment industry legal action against generative AI. Unlike previous cases brought by individual authors or small publishers, this suit brought the resources and legal firepower of major studios to bear against an AI company.

The implications extend beyond Midjourney. Disney and Universal's characters, from Marvel superheroes to classic animated icons, are among the most recognizable and valuable intellectual property in the world. A ruling that AI companies cannot train on such content—or must license it—would reshape the economics of generative AI development.

## The Music Industry Front

The copyright battles extended to AI music generation as well. Independent artists led by Anthony Justice and 5th Wheel Records filed a class action lawsuit against Suno, targeting the AI music platform's use of copyrighted music for training.

Suno responded with a bold legal argument: that none of the millions of tracks created on its platform contain anything resembling a sample of copyrighted music. The company contended that its AI creates genuinely new compositions rather than reproducing or remixing existing works.

The argument cuts to the heart of how generative AI works. If AI models learn patterns and styles from training data but don't reproduce specific content, are they infringing copyright? Or are they doing something more analogous to a human musician who learns from listening to existing music?

## Authors Expand the Battlefront

Even as some cases resolved, new ones emerged. On June 25, a group of authors filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, claiming the company used their books without permission to train its AI systems. The suit expanded the legal battlefront beyond the usual targets of OpenAI and Anthropic to include one of the world's largest technology companies.

Meanwhile, six authors who opted out of the proposed Anthropic settlement filed individual lawsuits against Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity AI. They sought $150,000 per title from each defendant under the Copyright Act—a strategy that, if successful across the industry, could result in astronomical damages.

## The Settlement Path

The legal developments of June 2025 suggested that many AI copyright disputes may ultimately resolve through settlement rather than definitive court rulings. The Bartz v. Anthropic case, despite its significant fair use ruling, would later settle for what was described as America's largest copyright settlement.

Settlements offer advantages for both sides. AI companies avoid the risk of adverse precedent and potentially massive damages. Content creators receive compensation and, in some cases, ongoing licensing arrangements. But settlements also leave fundamental legal questions unresolved, creating continued uncertainty for the industry.

## Implications for AI Development

The copyright battles of June 2025 carry significant implications for how AI systems are developed going forward. Several trends are emerging:

**Training data provenance** is becoming critical. AI companies are increasingly documenting where their training data comes from and ensuring they have appropriate rights. The days of scraping the internet without regard to copyright are ending.

**Licensing deals** are proliferating. Rather than risk litigation, AI companies are striking deals with content owners—from news publishers to music labels to individual creators. These arrangements create new revenue streams for content creators while providing legal cover for AI developers.

**Synthetic data** is gaining importance. Some AI companies are exploring training on AI-generated content or carefully curated licensed datasets to avoid copyright exposure entirely.

**Open-source implications** are unclear. Models trained on potentially infringing data and released as open-source create complex liability questions. Who is responsible if an open-source model was trained on pirated books?

## What It Means

The copyright developments of June 2025 represent neither total victory for AI companies nor decisive wins for content creators. Instead, they reveal a legal landscape in flux, where the rules governing AI training are being written in real-time through litigation, settlement, and legislative action.

For AI developers, the message is clear: the legal risks of training on copyrighted content are real and growing. Companies that haven't already should be auditing their training data, establishing licensing relationships, and preparing for a future where "we trained on everything we could find" is no longer an acceptable answer.

For content creators, the developments offer both hope and caution. Courts are taking copyright claims seriously, and major settlements suggest AI companies are willing to pay for content. But the fair use rulings also indicate that not all AI training will be found infringing, and the legal path to compensation remains uncertain and expensive.

The copyright battles of 2025 are far from over. But June's developments made clear that the era of legal reckoning for AI training has arrived.
