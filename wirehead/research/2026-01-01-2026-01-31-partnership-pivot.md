## The Deals That Shook the Industry

Two announcements in January 2026 fundamentally altered the competitive landscape of artificial intelligence. Apple chose Google—not OpenAI—to power the next generation of Siri. And Disney signed a $1 billion licensing deal to bring its characters to OpenAI's Sora video generator. Together, these partnerships reveal a maturing industry where strategic alliances matter as much as technical capabilities.

## Apple's Gemini Gambit

On January 12, Apple confirmed what had been rumored for months: the company would partner with Google to use Gemini AI models to power Siri and other Apple Intelligence features. The multi-year deal represents Apple's most significant AI partnership and a major win for Google in its battle against OpenAI.

The announcement came after Apple had delayed its promised Siri AI upgrade from 2025 to 2026, despite running advertisements for the product. The pressure to deliver an impressive AI voice assistant had mounted throughout 2025, and Apple ultimately concluded that Google's Gemini offered the best path forward.

"It's official. Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri," TechCrunch reported. The deal builds on the companies' existing relationship—Google has long paid Apple billions annually to be the default search engine on iOS devices.

During Apple's Q1 2026 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh fielded multiple questions about the partnership structure. Cook reiterated that Apple would use custom Gemini models tailored to Apple's privacy requirements, with processing happening on-device where possible.

The partnership is expected to roll out later in 2026, with Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reporting that Apple plans to unveil the new Gemini-powered Siri at WWDC. The upgrade will reportedly enable more natural conversations, better context retention, and the ability to perform complex multi-step tasks.

For Google, the deal validates its Gemini strategy and provides a massive distribution channel. Google's valuation hit $4 trillion on the news, buoyed by AI momentum and optimism about the Apple partnership.

## Disney Bets on Sora

If the Apple-Google deal was about infrastructure, the Disney-OpenAI partnership was about imagination. On January 7, the entertainment giant announced a landmark three-year licensing agreement allowing OpenAI's Sora video generator to create content featuring more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars characters.

The deal, reportedly worth $1 billion, represents the most significant licensing agreement between a major entertainment company and an AI firm. Under the terms, fans will be able to watch curated selections of Sora-generated videos on Disney+, and the companies will collaborate on new AI-powered experiences for subscribers.

"It's a whole new world for Mickey, Simba, Stitch and more," NPR observed, noting that the deal could fundamentally change how entertainment content is created and consumed.

The partnership was not without controversy. Fairplay, a nonprofit focused on children's media, raised concerns about AI-generated content featuring beloved characters. Critics questioned whether the deal would accelerate the replacement of human animators and artists with AI systems.

But Disney CEO Bob Iger framed the partnership as an opportunity rather than a threat. The Hollywood Reporter analyzed the deal as potentially enabling "a new kind of high-end user-generated material, an AI TikTok" built around Disney's intellectual property.

Legal experts noted the deal's significance for IP licensing in the AI era. "The Walt Disney Company's newly announced licensing agreement with OpenAI marks a pivotal moment at the intersection of intellectual property and generative AI," observed one analysis. The structure could serve as a template for other entertainment companies navigating the AI transition.

## The Market Share Earthquake

These partnerships occurred against a backdrop of dramatic shifts in AI market dynamics. Data from SimilarWeb released in January revealed that ChatGPT's dominance was eroding faster than anyone expected.

ChatGPT's traffic share among generative AI chatbot websites dropped from 86.7% in January 2025 to just 64.5% in January 2026—a staggering 22-percentage-point decline. Simultaneously, Google Gemini surged from a modest 5.7% to 21.5%, a nearly fourfold increase.

"The dramatic market share shifts revealed in SimilarWeb's January 2026 data mark the end of ChatGPT's monopolistic era and the beginning of a genuinely competitive AI chatbot market," analysts observed.

The numbers tell a nuanced story. OpenAI still grew in absolute terms—from 300 million weekly active users in January 2025 to 900 million in January 2026. But the total AI chatbot market grew even faster, and competitors captured a disproportionate share of that growth.

Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot integrated into X, overtook Perplexity in market share. Claude, Anthropic's offering, also gained ground. The era of ChatGPT as the default AI interface is ending, replaced by a fragmented market where users choose based on specific capabilities, integrations, and preferences.

## What the Partnerships Reveal

The January deals illuminate several important trends:

**Distribution trumps capability.** Google's Gemini may or may not be technically superior to GPT-4 or Claude. But by securing the Apple partnership, Google gained access to over a billion iOS devices. In consumer AI, distribution advantages can outweigh technical ones.

**IP holders are engaging, not retreating.** Disney's decision to license its characters to Sora suggests that major IP holders see AI as an opportunity rather than purely a threat. Rather than fighting AI-generated content, Disney is positioning itself to profit from it.

**The platform wars are intensifying.** Apple's choice of Google over OpenAI reflects the complex competitive dynamics of the AI era. Apple and Google are rivals in many areas, but their partnership against OpenAI suggests that preventing any single company from dominating AI is a shared priority.

**Vertical integration has limits.** Apple, despite its resources, concluded that building competitive AI models in-house was not the best strategy. The company's willingness to partner rather than build suggests that AI development has reached a scale and complexity that even the world's most valuable company cannot easily replicate.

**The advertising question looms.** OpenAI's CFO has described ads as a "last resort" for monetization, but the Disney deal points toward alternative revenue streams. Licensing, partnerships, and enterprise deals may prove more sustainable than competing with Google in advertising.

## The Road Ahead

The partnerships announced in January 2026 are just the beginning. Industry observers expect a wave of similar deals as AI capabilities mature and companies seek strategic advantages.

For Apple users, the Gemini-powered Siri promises to finally deliver on the vision of a truly intelligent assistant—years after competitors demonstrated what was possible. For Disney fans, the Sora partnership opens new possibilities for engaging with beloved characters, even as it raises questions about the future of human creativity.

For the AI industry as a whole, January's deals signal that the era of standalone AI companies may be giving way to an era of AI-powered ecosystems, where the winners are those who can combine technical capabilities with distribution, content, and strategic partnerships.

The ChatGPT monopoly is over. What comes next is anyone's guess.
