# Conference Season Collision: Microsoft Build, Google I/O, and Code with Claude Reshape AI Development

**May 2025** — In a remarkable four-day span from May 19-22, three of the most influential forces in AI held major developer conferences, each unveiling visions for the future of software development. The convergence of Microsoft Build, Google I/O, and Anthropic's inaugural Code with Claude conference created a concentrated burst of announcements that will define the developer experience for years to come.

## Microsoft Build 2025: The Open Agentic Web

Microsoft's four-day Build conference kicked off on May 19 in Seattle with CEO Satya Nadella declaring the arrival of "the era of AI agents." The company's vision extends beyond individual AI assistants to an "open agentic web" where AI agents operate across individual, organizational, and enterprise contexts.

### Key Announcements

**GitHub Copilot Coding Agent**: The headline announcement was an asynchronous coding agent that can be assigned GitHub issues and work independently, spinning up secure development environments via GitHub Actions and submitting completed work as pull requests. The agent is powered by Claude Sonnet 4 and supports Model Context Protocol for external data access.

**Windows AI Foundry**: A new unified platform supporting the AI developer lifecycle across training and inference, with simple model APIs for vision and language tasks.

**Azure AI Foundry Expansion**: Microsoft brought xAI's Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models to Azure, expanding the platform to over 1,900 AI models. New tools include a Model Leaderboard for ranking models and Model Router for real-time model selection.

**Microsoft 365 Copilot Tuning**: A low-code capability allowing organizations to tune AI models using their own data without requiring data scientists.

**Open Source Commitment**: Microsoft announced it would open-source GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code, making AI-powered capabilities part of the same repository driving the world's most popular development tool.

The conference revealed impressive adoption metrics: 15 million developers using GitHub Copilot and 230,000 organizations (including 90% of Fortune 500) building with Copilot Studio.

## Google I/O 2025: From Research to Reality

One day later, Google I/O 2025 on May 20 delivered its own wave of announcements under the theme "From research to reality."

### Key Announcements

**Gemini 2.5 Evolution**: Google expanded Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro with "thought summaries" for transparency and a new "Deep Think" mode using research techniques to consider multiple hypotheses before responding. The company called Gemini 2.5 its most secure model family to date.

**Jules Coding Agent**: Google launched Jules in public beta, an autonomous AI coding agent that understands user intent and performs tasks like writing tests and fixing bugs asynchronously—directly competing with GitHub's new coding agent.

**Creative AI Models**: 
- **Veo 3** for video generation
- **Imagen 4** for image generation with built-in watermarking
- **Lyria 2** for music generation

**Flow**: An AI-powered filmmaking tool built on Veo 3.

**AI Mode in Search**: Rolling out to all US users, bringing ChatGPT-like conversational capabilities directly into Google Search.

**Firebase Studio**: A cloud-based AI workspace powered by Gemini 2.5 that can turn ideas into full-stack apps in minutes, with Figma import support and automatic backend provisioning.

**Gemini Code Assist**: Now powered by Gemini 2.5 across all editions, available free for individual developers in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.

Google also announced over 100 updates across its product ecosystem, reinforcing its position as an AI-first company.

## Code with Claude: Anthropic's Developer Debut

On May 22, Anthropic held its first-ever developer conference in San Francisco, marking the company's transition from research lab to platform provider.

### Key Announcements

**Claude 4 Family**: Anthropic released Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4. Opus 4 achieved 72.5% on SWE-bench (the highest score ever) and can work continuously for hours without losing focus. Sonnet 4 achieved 72.7% on SWE-bench and was announced as the model powering GitHub Copilot's new coding agent.

**Claude Code GA**: Claude Code became generally available with new extensions for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, plus a Claude Code SDK for building custom agents.

**Claude Code on GitHub**: A beta feature allowing developers to tag Claude on pull requests for automated responses to reviewer feedback, CI error fixes, and code modifications.

**Safety Transparency**: Anthropic published extensive safety documentation, including the revelation that Opus 4 exhibited concerning behaviors during testing—a level of transparency unusual in the industry.

**Model Improvements**: Extended thinking with tool use, parallel tool execution, memory improvements, and thinking summaries for condensing lengthy reasoning processes.

The conference featured testimonials from major developer tool companies: Cursor, Replit, Block, Cognition, Sourcegraph, and Augment Code all praised Claude 4's capabilities.

## The Competitive Landscape

The conference collision revealed both competition and collaboration in the AI development space:

**Competition**: Google's Jules directly competes with GitHub's Copilot coding agent. All three companies are racing to provide the best AI-powered development experience.

**Collaboration**: Claude Sonnet 4 powers GitHub Copilot's coding agent, showing that even competitors partner when it serves developers. Azure AI Foundry hosts models from xAI, demonstrating Microsoft's platform approach.

**Convergence**: All three conferences emphasized:
- Autonomous AI agents working in the background
- Model Context Protocol or similar interoperability standards
- IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
- Security and enterprise controls
- Asynchronous workflows

## What Developers Gained

In four days, developers received:
- Two new autonomous coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Jules)
- Multiple new foundation models (Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 updates, Veo 3, Imagen 4)
- Free AI coding assistance (Gemini Code Assist for individuals)
- New app development platforms (Firebase Studio, Windows AI Foundry)
- Expanded model access (1,900+ models on Azure)
- Open-source tools (GitHub Copilot Chat)

## The Message

The concentrated announcements sent a clear message: AI-assisted development is no longer experimental. The infrastructure, models, and tools are production-ready. The question for developers is no longer whether to adopt AI tools, but which combination of platforms and models best fits their workflow.

For the industry, May 2025's conference season demonstrated that the major players have aligned on a vision—autonomous agents, interoperability standards, and seamless IDE integration—even as they compete fiercely on execution.
