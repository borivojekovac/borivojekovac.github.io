# Zeitgeist: The Reckoning

## December 2025 delivered the correction - three flagship models shipped in two weeks while the market leader declared code red, Nvidia spent $20 billion to own inference, Washington preempted state AI laws, and the hype finally met its ceiling as agents failed their workplace auditions.

November had compressed the release cycle. December compressed the illusion.

The model drops arrived like scheduled product refreshes. [Google shipped Gemini 3 Deep Think December 4](https://shellypalmer.com/2025/12/an-ai-december-to-remember/ "Google Gemini 3 updates in December"), enhanced reasoning through parallel hypothesis exploration, 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2. OpenAI followed with GPT-5.2 December 11, claiming 70.9% expert parity on knowledge work. GPT-5.2-Codex December 18, state-of-the-art on SWE-Bench Pro. Google countered same day with Gemini 3 Flash, Pro-grade reasoning at Flash-level speed. Anthropic had already dropped Opus 4.5 pricing to $5/$25 late November, making flagship intelligence commodity-priced. Three labs, six major releases, fourteen days. The Samsung Galaxy era of LLMs fully materialized.

But behind the launch cadence, pressure mounted. [December 2, Sam Altman sent the memo](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/open-ai-code-red-google-anthropic.html "OpenAI code red memo"): code red. OpenAI pulling back from health, shopping, advertising to focus on ChatGPT itself. The market leader with 800 million weekly users declaring emergency protocols while Google's Gemini claimed 650 million monthly actives and Anthropic's large accounts grew 4x year-over-year. Not market dynamics but velocity trap - competitors shipping faster, cheaper, more embedded. The code red wasn't about capability. It was about relevance.

The infrastructure play landed December 24. [Nvidia acquired Groq's assets for $20 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/24/nvidia-buying-ai-chip-startup-groq-for-about-20-billion-biggest-deal.html "Nvidia Groq acquisition"), largest deal in company history. Not buying a competitor but absorbing inference architecture, hiring the CEO and senior team, licensing the low-latency processors. Groq had raised $750 million at $6.9 billion valuation in September. Three months later, 3x premium. The chip wars consolidating around training and inference as separate battlegrounds, Nvidia ensuring it owned both. Intelligence as vertical integration, compute as moat.

Washington moved to centralize control. [December 11, Trump signed Executive Order 14365](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/ "Trump AI executive order"), establishing federal AI framework, preempting state laws that "require AI models to alter their truthful outputs." [The order targeted California's regulations](https://www.sidley.com/en/insights/newsupdates/2025/12/unpacking-the-december-11-2025-executive-order "Analysis of AI executive order"), threatened to withhold broadband funding from states with "onerous AI laws," directed FTC to issue policy statements on deceptive AI practices. Not safety regulation but content deregulation, framing state oversight as obstruction. Intelligence as federal jurisdiction, alignment as political variable.

But December's undertow pulled harder than its announcements. [MIT Technology Review declared "the great AI hype correction"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129174/the-great-ai-hype-correction-of-2025/ "MIT Tech Review hype correction article") mid-month. GPT-5 had underwhelmed in August. November's Upwork study showed agents from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic failing straightforward workplace tasks. [The New Yorker asked why AI didn't transform our lives in 2025](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2025-in-review/why-ai-didnt-transform-our-lives-in-2025 "New Yorker AI transformation article"). The industry had promised autonomous agents joining the workforce. December delivered browser extensions that still needed supervision. Capability advancing, but the gap between demo and deployment widening rather than closing.

December's lesson arrived as counterpoint to November's acceleration. The models kept shipping, the money kept flowing, the consolidation kept tightening. But the technology had stopped surprising, started disappointing, revealed its limits not through failure but through familiarity. Intelligence as utility rather than revolution, progress measured in benchmark points rather than breakthroughs. The future still arriving, but arriving as iteration, not transformation. The hype meeting its ceiling while the infrastructure bets doubled down, the regulatory framework centralized, and the market leader scrambled to stay relevant in a race where velocity had replaced vision as the primary metric.

The agents weren't autonomous. They were adequate. And adequate was the new frontier.
